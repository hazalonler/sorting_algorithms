# Sorting Algorithms

In this repository, main sorting algorithms are mentioned and their implementations shown. 
These algorithms are; 

1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort 
3. Insertion Sort 
4. Counting Sort 
5. Merge Sort 
6. Quick Sort

Time complexity values respectively as below;

1. Q(n2)
2. Q(n2) -- worst case solution or Q(n) -- best case solution
3. Q(n2)
4. Q(n+k) -- k is the range of input
5. Q(nlog(n))
6. Q(n2) -- worst case solution (like insertion sort) or Q(nlog(n)) -- best case solution

When merge and quick sort methods are mentioned, _**divide and conquer**_ algorithm must be determined well. First of all, 
a pivot element is selected to divide the array into many subarray. If subarray is small enough such as length of 1 to 
compare with other subarray, they can be combined to become main sorted array.
